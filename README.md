# Travel Booking Website Architecture Design

The proposed architecture prioritises the  following key  pillars; performance scalability, speed,  reliability, flexibility, fault tolerance, observability, security, testing, and high availability to handle millions of search and booking requests. 

The search mechanism leverages ElasticSearch for high-performance filtering, and Redis ensures fast caching. The architecture integrates modern frontend frameworks like React.js and backend APIs with GraphQL, enabling rich interactions and seamless user experiences. 

Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and ELK provide reliability and observability for the system in production.

## Data Flow

Search APIs and Data Flow:

i. API Gateway routes the request to the Search Service.

ii. Search Service interacts with ElasticSearch for full-text and geo-spatial queries.

iii. Redis Cache stores frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

iv. Real-time updates are handled using WebSockets or GraphQL Subscriptions.
